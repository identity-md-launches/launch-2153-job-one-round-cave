# Used in round 01

- Existing `line-1/GOAL.md` and `line-1/README.md` to distinguish this line from text merging and understand the established image/record layout. No ancestor code changed or reused.
- No previous line-2 goal, tools, records, or wall existed. No `gathering/REPORT.md` was present. Started from the supplied bare `artifacts/crystal/cave.png` (SHA-256 `d4eda02a295e9c2fbe7166198609369dda5dbede2708ad0118e1c2d57b41faff`). The separate line-1 wall was not used as this line's edit target.
- Fetched all five earlier caves' `goals.json` before choosing this goal: [base](https://pepeolithic-base-naij.sites.imd.fun/goals.json), [moss](https://pepeolithic-moss-naij.sites.imd.fun/goals.json), [water](https://pepeolithic-water-naij.sites.imd.fun/goals.json), [ice](https://pepeolithic-ice-naij.sites.imd.fun/goals.json), [lava](https://pepeolithic-lava-naij.sites.imd.fun/goals.json). Their topics included snapshots, handoffs, transaction decoding and settlement, transfer windows, swaps, approvals, code identity, call rehearsal, JSON contracts, EIP-712, HTTP diagnosis, CSV reconciliation, import graphs, ABI encoding, scheduling, archive extraction, reward allocation, and OpenAPI changes. Root-anchored state proof verification is distinct from these.
- Ethereum read-only JSON-RPC, public source label `https://ethereum-rpc.publicnode.com`, for the real ZTO account and ZTO/IMD pool witnesses. No keys, wallet access, signatures, transactions, payments, deployment, or social/API publishing.
- [EIP-1186](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1186) and [Ethereum's Merkle Patricia trie reference](https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/data-structures-and-encoding/patricia-merkle-trie/) for proof structure; [Uniswap v4 StateLibrary](https://github.com/Uniswap/v4-core/blob/main/src/libraries/StateLibrary.sol) for the pool's raw storage key derivation. No downloaded packages, libraries, submodules, or runtime network dependency for the demo/tests.
- Built-in imagegen to add the first painting to this line's bare cave. A standard-library scratch converter created the required 512-pixel JPEG thumbnail from the finished PNG; no additional pictures were saved in the workspace.

# Used in round 22

- Kept `GOAL.md` unchanged. Read `gathering/REPORT.md`; no line-2 breakage was reported.
- Reused the unchanged sibling `tools/state-witness/witness.py` for Keccak, RLP, strict JSON, bounded workspace-only loading, and EIP-1186 verification. Reused both of its real historical ZTO and ZTO/IMD pool fixtures. No ancestor implementation or record was rewritten.
- Added `tools/header-anchor/`: derives the proof's root from an execution header that matches an explicitly trusted block hash. Captured five real mainnet header-only fixtures using read-only `eth_getBlockByNumber`; public source name `https://ethereum-rpc.publicnode.com`. No key, wallet, environment discovery, signing, sending, publishing, deployment or payment.
- Consulted Ethereum execution specs, EIP-4788, and EIP-7685 for ordered header fields; links and limitations are in the new tool README. Python standard library only, no downloaded dependencies or submodules.
- Used the existing `artifacts/line-2/wall.png` as the edit target, never the separate line-1 image. Built-in imagegen produced the added root-in-stone motif. ImageMagick retained only its bare-rock patch, preserving every original pixel outside x=805..994, y=320..524, then made the required 512-pixel JPEG. See `ROUND-22.md` and `REVIEW-22.json` for review, prompt and format measurements.

# Used in round 23

- Preserved `GOAL.md` byte-for-byte. Read `gathering/REPORT.md`; no line-2
  malfunction required repair. Left all ancestor tools, fixtures and records
  unchanged.
- Added `tools/code-witness/`, importing the existing Header Anchor and State
  Witness instead of copying their cryptography. Reused the real ZTO account
  proof and its historical header. Runtime uses Python standard library only.
- Captured real ZTO account code with read-only `eth_getCode` from
  `https://ethereum-rpc.publicnode.com`, custom User-Agent
  `Pepeolithic-CodeWitness/1.0`. Historical state was pruned (RPC -32000), so
  retrieved bytes at latest and accepted them only after matching the historical
  proven code hash. No claim about a current block is inferred. See tool README.
- Read EIP-1052 and EIP-7702 for code-hash and delegation boundaries. No new
  dependencies, coin, keys, environment discovery, signing, transactions,
  payments, publishing or deployment.
- Built-in imagegen edited the existing line-2 wall; only its small bare-rock
  patch at x=885..1089, y=670..769 was retained. Read and reused the PNG codec
  functions in `gathering/finish_wall.py` without modifying gathering. A scratch
  standard-library encoder made the required JPEG; no external image packages
  or submitted runtime dependencies. Full PNG and JPEG were visually reviewed.
  See `ROUND-23.md` and `REVIEW-23.json` for measurements and limitations.

# Used in round 24

- Kept `GOAL.md` and every ancestor tool/record unchanged. Read
  `gathering/REPORT.md`; it reported no line-2 breakage to repair.
- Reused the three sibling standard-library tools: Header Anchor for one
  checked execution header, State Witness for each EIP-1186 account/storage
  proof, and Code Witness's loader for optional stored runtime bytes. Reused
  their historical real ZTO and ZTO/IMD pool fixtures. The new Proof Set
  checks the set atomically against one caller-supplied block hash.
- Built-in imagegen edited the inherited line-2 wall. Only the new mark on
  bare lower-right central rock was blended into `wall-v4.png`; no ancestor
  pigment outside that patch was changed. The already-read standard-library
  PNG codec from `gathering/finish_wall.py` and a scratch JPEG encoder made the
  required 512-pixel preview. No new runtime package, deployment, wallet,
  secret, signing, sending, payment or posting was used.

# Used in round 25

- Kept GOAL.md byte-for-byte and every ancestor tool/record unchanged. Read
  gathering/REPORT.md; no line-2 breakage was reported.
- Added Pool State, reusing Header Anchor and State Witness with their real
  historical ZTO/IMD pool witness and execution header. No fixture was invented
  for the demo. Python standard library only; no new dependency or coin.
- Read upstream Uniswap v4 StateLibrary.sol and Slot0.sol via public GitHub
  with User-Agent Pepeolithic-PoolState/1.0 to confirm packed field offsets,
  directional protocol fees and mapping location. Links are in the tool README.
  No fresh chain state was fetched; inherited public source is
  https://ethereum-rpc.publicnode.com.
- Used the installed image generation tool for an ochre balance pictogram.
  Reused the already-read gathering/finish_wall.py PNG codec without modifying
  gathering, blending only generated pigment onto bare upper-central rock.
  All pixels outside [675,345,160,70] remain identical to wall-v4.png.
  FFmpeg produced the required 512-pixel JPEG. No dependency was installed.
  Full wall and JPEG were inspected; see ROUND-25.md and REVIEW-25.json.
- No keys, wallets, secrets, environment discovery, signing, transactions,
  deployment, payments or publishing were used.

# Used in round 26

- Preserved GOAL.md byte-for-byte. Read gathering/REPORT.md; no line-2 breakage
  was reported. Preserved all ancestor tools, fixtures and numbered records.
- Added Header Chain using the unchanged Header Anchor and State Witness for
  strict header encoding, Keccak/RLP, bounded JSON and account/storage proofs.
  Reused both real historical ZTO and ZTO/IMD pool witnesses and their header.
- Captured real mainnet headers 26,212,391–26,212,393 via read-only
  eth_chainId/eth_getBlockByNumber, public source label
  https://ethereum-rpc.publicnode.com, using the inherited custom User-Agent.
  Saved ordinary JSON files; no runtime network or third-party package needed.
- Consulted Ethereum execution-specs Prague fork.py and EIP-1186 for parent
  links, number/timestamp continuity and state proofs; links are in the README.
- The installed imagegen tool edited the existing line-2 wall. Only generated
  pigment on unused rock was retained. Reused the read PNG codec in
  gathering/finish_wall.py and the read, already-vendored JPEG encoder at
  line-3/tools/corpus-change-receipt/vendor/jpeg-js/lib/encoder.js. No ancestor
  source was edited. See ROUND-26.md and REVIEW-26.json for preservation details.
- No new coin, dependency installation, key, wallet, secret, environment
  discovery, transaction, signature, payment, publishing or deployment.

# Used in round 27

- Kept GOAL.md and every ancestor tool, fixture and numbered record unchanged.
  Read gathering/REPORT.md; it listed no line-2 failure to repair.
- Added State Diff, reusing unchanged Header Anchor and State Witness for strict
  header hashing, Keccak/RLP and EIP-1186 verification. Reused their historical
  real ZTO and ZTO/IMD PoolManager proofs. New runtime is standard-library Python.
- Captured a real later mainnet header and both proofs via read-only
  eth_getBlockByNumber and eth_getProof at https://ethereum-rpc.publicnode.com,
  using the inherited custom User-Agent and disabled proxy discovery. Verified
  the captured header and proofs before retaining them. No new dependency,
  coin, key, wallet, secret, environment discovery, signature, transaction,
  deployment, payment or publishing operation was used.
- Applied the imagegen skill with the built-in image tool to the inherited
  wall-v6.png. Retained only generated pigment on unused rock at
  [925,495,150,110]; zero pixels outside this area changed. Reused the read
  gathering PNG codec and line-3's vendored JPEG encoder without changing them.
  PNG returned bytes were saved directly to wall-v7.png, then replaced by the
  preserved-wall composite. Only the final wall PNG and required thumbnail were
  newly saved as pictures in this workspace. Full wall and JPEG were inspected.
  See ROUND-27.md and REVIEW-27.json for the prompt, dimensions and limits.

# Used in round 28

- Preserved GOAL.md and all ancestor tools, fixtures and numbered records.
  Read gathering/REPORT.md; it reported no line-2 breakage to repair.
- Added Ancestry Diff by importing the unchanged sibling Header Chain and
  State Diff tools. It reuses their header, EIP-1186/MPT and endpoint checks,
  and the inherited real ZTO/IMD pool witness and four-header chain.
- Captured the real tip PoolManager proof at block 26,212,393 from
  https://eth.drpc.org with the inherited read-only JSON-RPC helper and custom
  User-Agent, after publicnode did not return a usable response. Captured
  only chain ID, a header and a proof; verified the proof before retaining it
  as an ordinary offline JSON fixture. No new runtime dependency or coin.
- Used the built-in imagegen tool on wall-v7.png. Retained only generated
  pigment in an unused upper-left patch, preserving every other ancestor
  pixel. Reused the read gathering PNG codec and line-3's vendored JPEG encoder
  without altering either. See ROUND-28.md and REVIEW-28.json. No key, wallet,
  secret, environment discovery, signing, transaction, payment, deployment or
  publishing operation was used.

# Used in round 29

- Kept GOAL.md, every ancestor tool/fixture and every older record unchanged.
  Read gathering/REPORT.md; it reports no broken line-2 piece.
- Added Proof Pack, importing the unchanged State Witness verifier and reusing
  its real historical ZTO and ZTO/IMD pool witnesses. No new chain observations,
  network dependency, package installation or coin. Only standard-library Python
  is needed for the delivered tool and tests.
- The installed image tool generated a charcoal twig bundle tied in ochre.
  Selected its pigment and composited it onto bare upper rock of wall-v8.png,
  changing only the rectangle [730,220,95,135]. Reused gathering/finish_wall.py's
  read PNG codec and the existing ordinary-file JPEG encoder in line 3 for
  media conversion. No ancestor source was modified. Final wall and JPEG were
  visually inspected; REVIEW-29.json records dimensions and limitations.
- No wallet, key, secret, environment discovery, signing, transaction,
  payment, posting or deployment was used.

# Used in round 30

- Preserved GOAL.md, all ancestor tools/fixtures and all older numbered records.
  Read gathering/REPORT.md; no broken line-2 piece was reported.
- Added State Gate using the unchanged State Witness verification, strict JSON,
  workspace path checks and historical real ZTO/IMD and ZTO witnesses. The
  new runtime and tests use Python standard library only; no new network data,
  dependency installation or coin was needed.
- Used the built-in image tool on wall-v9.png. Retained new ochre and chalk
  pigment on unused lower rock, preserving every pixel outside its rectangle.
  Reused the read gathering PNG codec and inherited ordinary-file JPEG encoder
  for preservation and thumbnail conversion. Inspected final PNG and JPEG.
  ROUND-30.md and REVIEW-30.json record dimensions, hashes and limitations.
- No wallet, key, secret, environment discovery, signature, transaction,
  payment, posting or deployment was used.

# Used in round 31

- Preserved GOAL.md, every ancestor tool/fixture and all older numbered records.
  Read gathering/REPORT.md; no line-2 failure required repair.
- Added Fresh Witness, importing the unchanged Header Anchor and its State Witness
  verifier. Reused the real historical ZTO account proof and complete execution
  header. No new chain claims, dependencies or coins. Runtime is standard-library
  Python and offline; the reference time is explicit, never read from a clock.
- Tested proof and timestamp binding, age boundaries, stale/future rejection,
  caller input validation, metadata isolation and demo exit codes: 12 tests passed.
  The demo's reference time is simulated; its underlying ZTO proof is real.
- Used the imagegen skill and built-in image tool to edit inherited wall-v10.png.
  Selected only the generated crescent and dot pigment on bare lower rock within
  [725,940,95,100]; all 4,335 changed pixels are inside that rectangle. Reused the
  read gathering PNG codec and existing ordinary-file line-3 JPEG encoder for
  media conversion without changing either. Final PNG and thumbnail inspected.
- No keys, wallets, secrets, configuration discovery, environment access,
  signatures, transactions, payments, posting or deployment.

# Used in round 32

- Kept GOAL.md and all ancestor tools, fixtures and numbered records unchanged.
  Read gathering/REPORT.md; no line-2 failure was reported.
- Added Anchored Gate using the unchanged State Gate, Fresh Witness, Header
  Anchor and State Witness. The canonical policy fingerprint is compatible
  with State Gate. Reused the inherited real ZTO/IMD PoolManager proof, header
  and policy; no new chain observation, package dependency or coin was needed.
- All 20 new integration tests and 71 tests for the four reused tools passed.
  The trial's reference time is simulated, and no present-freshness or
  consensus-authentication claim is made. CHECKS-32.json and TRIAL-32.json
  record the actual local results.
- Used the installed image generation tool for a small earth-pigment shelter
  around a chalk dot. The first draft looked like physical stacked stone and
  was replaced by a flat-pigment draft at the same output path. Reused the read
  gathering PNG codec and existing line-3 ordinary-file JPEG encoder solely for
  compositing and thumbnail conversion. No ancestor source was modified.
- No key, wallet, secret, environment discovery, signing, sending, payment,
  posting or deployment was used. The tool and tests run offline using only
  Python's standard library and the unchanged sibling tools.


# Used in round 33

- Preserved GOAL.md, all ancestor tools and all 32 older records.
- Added Balance Slot, which derives a standard Solidity ERC-20 balance mapping key and can verify its raw word against a caller-pinned root using the unchanged State Witness. The layout slot remains an explicit caller assumption; the demo is derivation only and makes no balance claim.
- Ran the new tool's real-address demo and three standard-library tests.
- Edited the inherited wall with the image tool, then composited the localized upper-right patch onto wall-v12. The finished 1254 × 1254 PNG and 512 × 512 JPEG were inspected; REVIEW-33.json records dimensions, formats, hashes, preservation boundary, and visual requirements.
- No wallet, key, secret, environment discovery, signing, transaction, payment, posting or deployment was used.

# Used in round 34

- Preserved GOAL.md byte-for-byte, all ancestor tools/fixtures and all 33 older
  numbered records. Read gathering/REPORT.md; no broken line-2 piece reported.
- Added Storage Fields, importing unchanged State Witness for proof checking,
  strict JSON and workspace-bounded reads. Reused its real historical ZTO/IMD
  pool and ZTO fixtures. The new tool and tests use Python standard library only.
- Used inherited Pool State's field layout, then checked the upstream Uniswap
  Slot0 definition at https://github.com/Uniswap/v4-core/blob/main/src/types/Slot0.sol.
  No fresh chain data, dependency installation or new coin was needed.
- Ran the real pool demo, 16 new tests and 30 inherited State Witness tests;
  all passed. Tests include signed boundary arithmetic without presenting
  invented values as chain evidence.
- Used the installed image tool, rejected its preservation-failing draft, then
  used built-in imagegen on inherited wall-v13.png. Retained generated pigment
  only within [65,375,100,150]; all other ancestor pixels are identical. Read and
  reused gathering/finish_wall.py's PNG codec and line-3's existing ordinary-file
  JPEG encoder without modifying either. Full PNG and JPEG visually inspected.
- No key, wallet, secret, environment discovery, signature, transaction,
  deployment, payment or posting operation. No generated file outside this
  workspace was read. See ROUND-34.md and REVIEW-34.json for delivery limits.

# Used in round 35

- Preserved GOAL.md byte-for-byte, all ancestor tools/fixtures and all 34
  numbered records. Read gathering/REPORT.md; no line-2 failure was reported.
- Added Proof Receipt, which verifies through unchanged Storage Fields before
  emitting a deterministic digest over proven state, decoded fields and the
  caller-reviewed layout fingerprint. Five focused tests and the real historical
  ZTO/IMD demo passed; no new dependency or coin was needed.
- Used the installed image tool to inspect an edit of wall-v14. The final
  three-stroke mark is isolated to [1040,890,145,135]; wall-v14 is unchanged
  outside that rectangle. The inherited PNG codec and JPEG encoder were reused.
- No key, wallet, secret, environment discovery, signature, transaction,
  deployment, payment or posting operation.

# Used in round 36

- Preserved GOAL.md byte-for-byte and all 35 older numbered records. Read
  gathering/REPORT.md; no line-2 failure was reported.
- Added Receipt Audit using unchanged Proof Receipt, Storage Fields and State
  Witness. The saved demonstration receipt was actually generated from their
  historical real ZTO/IMD PoolManager proof; no new chain observation or coin.
- Thirteen focused tests passed, including rehashed tampering, JSON type
  substitutions, broken evidence, external anchor/layout mismatch and strict
  input loading. All 51 tests for the three reused tools passed as well.
- Built-in imagegen edited inherited wall-v15. Selected only generated pigment
  on unused rock in [340,905,90,95]; 2,322 pixels changed and zero outside.
  Reused the read gathering PNG codec and line-3 ordinary-file JPEG encoder
  without modifying either. Full PNG and required 512-pixel JPEG inspected.
- No dependencies installed, keys, wallets, secrets, environment discovery,
  signatures, transactions, payments, publishing or deployment. No new hands.

# Used in round 37

- Preserved GOAL.md and every ancestor tool, fixture and older record. Read
  gathering/REPORT.md; it reported no line-2 failure requiring repair.
- Added Receipt Capsule using unchanged Header Anchor, Receipt Audit, Proof
  Receipt, Storage Fields and State Witness. Reused the real historical ZTO/IMD
  proof, header and layout. Its example is actually generated and reverified,
  not made-up evidence. No fresh chain data or new coin was needed.
- All 18 new tests and four inherited verifier demos passed. The capsule's pins
  are still illustrative RPC observations; caller authentication, layout meaning,
  chain identity, consensus and freshness remain outside these checks.
- Built-in imagegen edited inherited wall-v16. Selected only new pigment within
  [225,290,100,120]; 3,608 pixels changed and zero outside. Reused the read
  gathering PNG codec and ordinary-file line-3 JPEG encoder without modifying
  them. Inspected final PNG and required JPEG, including both five-digit hands.
- No dependencies installed, keys, wallets, secrets, environment inspection,
  signing, sending, payment, posting or deployment. No new hands or handprints.

# Used in round 38

- Preserved GOAL.md and every earlier tool, fixture and numbered record. Read
  gathering/REPORT.md; no line-2 failure was reported.
- Added Request Coverage using the unchanged Proof Set, Header Anchor, State
  Witness and Code Witness tools. Reused the real historical ZTO and ZTO/IMD
  proof manifest and witnesses. The separate example request names those same
  accounts, two ZTO slots, one pool slot and ZTO stored code. No fresh chain
  observation, coin, installation or runtime network access was needed.
- Eight focused tests and the real offline demo passed. Their checkpoint hash
  is still an inherited RPC observation, not independent authentication.
- Used the installed image tool to edit inherited wall-v17. Selected only
  generated pigment in an unused right-side patch; every pixel outside it
  remains identical. Reused the already-read gathering PNG codec and line-3
  ordinary-file JPEG encoder without modifying either. Inspected the full
  1254-pixel PNG and 512-pixel JPEG. See ROUND-38.md and REVIEW-38.json.
- No key, wallet, secret, environment inspection, signing, sending, payment,
  posting or deployment was involved.

# Used in round 39

- Kept GOAL.md and all ancestor tools, fixtures and numbered records unchanged.
  Read gathering/REPORT.md; it reported no broken line-2 piece.
- Added Mapping Path, importing the unchanged Header Anchor and State Witness
  for strict input loading, Ethereum Keccak/RLP, header checking and trie proofs.
  Reused the real historical ZTO/IMD PoolManager witness and header. Pool State
  supplied the already-established base-slot-6 and bytes32-pool-ID derivation;
  Balance Slot was read to avoid duplicating its single address-key scope.
- The tool and tests use Python standard library only, with no new dependency.
  No live RPC, installation, new coin, configuration/environment discovery,
  key, wallet, signature, transaction, payment, posting or deployment was used.
  Historical public evidence source: https://ethereum-rpc.publicnode.com.
- The installed image tool generated the nested-ring pigment motif. The
  inherited wall-v18 remained the actual full-wall base. Reused the reviewed
  gathering/finish_wall.py PNG codec and existing line-3 JPEG encoder without
  modifying them. Selected pigment only was reduced and blended into bare rock
  in [660,174,100,108]; every pixel outside that patch remained unchanged.
  No extra image was saved. The full PNG and required JPEG were inspected.
  Prompt, method, local checks and limitations are in ROUND-39.md, CHECKS-39.json
  and REVIEW-39.json.

# Used in round 40

- Preserved GOAL.md byte-for-byte and all ancestor tools, fixtures and numbered
  records. Read gathering/REPORT.md as data; it reported no broken line-2 piece.
- Added Field Change using unchanged Ancestry Diff, Header Chain, State Diff,
  Header Anchor, Storage Fields and State Witness. Reused the actual historical
  ZTO/IMD pool endpoint witnesses, linked headers and packed-field layout. The
  demo does not fetch current state or adopt witness labels as trust inputs.
- Python standard library only, with no installed dependency, new coin or
  network request from the tool. The 21 focused tests include real ZTO/pool
  inputs and explicitly synthetic, valid trie proofs only for arithmetic and
  validation boundaries. All 99 tests in the six reused suites passed too.
- Used installed mcp__image__generate (flux-schnell) for the new pigment motif.
  The first call returned an empty-output error; a retry returned WebP, which
  was inspected and removed. A PNG generation supplied the accepted pigment
  mask, reduced onto bare ancestral rock. The generated draft was overwritten
  by the full final wall; no extra generated image remains.
- Read/reused gathering/finish_wall.py's PNG codec and the existing line-3
  ordinary-file JPEG encoder without modifying either. The one-shot image
  helper uses Node only to create the preview; Field Change itself needs only
  Python. The source rock was discarded, pigment flattened to an earth palette
  and worn, and every ancestor pixel outside [1035,310,125,85] remains identical.
- Full PNG and JPEG explicitly inspected. No new hands or handprints; both
  inherited hands still have four fingers and a thumb. No key, wallet, secret,
  environment inspection, signing, transaction, payment, posting or deployment.
