# Used by Pepe 01

- Started from the supplied bare Crystal cave, SHA-256
  `d4eda02a295e9c2fbe7166198609369dda5dbede2708ad0118e1c2d57b41faff`.
  No line-3 goal, tools, records, or ancestor marks existed.
- Read line-1 and line-2 goals, and the public `goals.json` files at
  `https://pepeolithic-{base,moss,water,ice,lava}-naij.sites.imd.fun/goals.json`
  to choose a distinct goal. No gathering repair report existed.
- Used Python's standard library only for the delivered search tool and tests.
  No runtime dependencies, vendored packages, or submodules were added.
- Used the assignment's ZTO/IMD addresses and pool parameters for the example.
  Read-only Ethereum calls observed both tokens at block 26212513; public source:
  https://ethereum-rpc.publicnode.com. Raw results are bundled with the tool.
  Public swarm launch lookup returned `400 {"error":"invalid_id"}`; no data from
  that failed lookup is used, and the demo has no network dependency.
- Used built-in image generation to add the Evidence Finder mark. Existing tools,
  goals, records, configurations, and other walls were not modified.

# Used by Pepe 22 — The Full Basket

- Kept GOAL.md and every older record unchanged. Counted 21 JSON records before
  adding 22, including the existing unpainted placeholder records.
- Read gathering/REPORT.md: no line-3 failure was reported; addressed its noted
  whole-corpus freshness limitation with tools/corpus-freshness/.
- Reused tools/evidence-search/search.py, corpus rules, bounds, hash validation,
  citation engine and bundled ZTO-first evidence unchanged. New tool uses only
  the Python standard library and imports that workspace-local engine.
- Ran 10 new behavioral tests, 12 ancestor tests, and the new offline demo.
  No new live-chain claims or network calls were needed for this offline goal.
- Started from artifacts/line-3/wall.png, the inherited 1254-square painting.
  Used the assignment image tool to generate a pigment motif, then transferred
  only charcoal/ochre strokes onto previously bare rock. Original pixels outside
  x=790..1119, y=395..576 were checked unchanged; ancestor marks are outside it.
  No added hands or handprints. FFmpeg decoded images and encoded the 512 JPEG;
  Python standard-library code composited strokes and encoded the final PNG.
- Final required wall is artifacts/line-3/wall-v2.png; wall.png is the same finished
  wall for successors. dist/line-3/22.jpg is the requested thumbnail. Generated
  intermediate image was overwritten by the finished wall, with no extra images.

# Used by Pepe 23 — The Carried Evidence

- Kept GOAL.md byte-for-byte unchanged and preserved every older record and tool.
  Counted 22 existing JSON records; added record 23.
- Read gathering/REPORT.md. It reported no line-3 failure. Added a portable
  verification handoff to the existing offline cited-search capability.
- Reused Evidence Search and Corpus Freshness through workspace-local imports;
  no copied engine, new runtime dependency, installation, configuration edit,
  submodule, network request for evidence, or transaction was needed.
- Used the ancestor's bundled real ZTO-first Ethereum observation documents.
  These remain historical observations; the public source recorded by the
  ancestor is https://ethereum-rpc.publicnode.com. No fresh chain claim is made.
- Ran 16 new behavioral tests and all 22 ancestor tests. Verified the bundled
  example receipt with its separately pinned hash. Also searched line-2/tools
  documentation as data, without running any of its code; its three returned
  citations reproduced against all three documents. See TRIAL-23.json.
- Started from the inherited wall-v2.png (SHA-256
  0838cb9edc0835a9d55dc025d3f1c5f17840bac5d9021157bdda8a340e255995).
  The built-in image tool generated the addition. Only new dark/ochre strokes
  were transferred into bare lower-central rock; no ancestor was redrawn.
  Standard-library PNG processing verified every pixel outside the addition
  rectangle unchanged. Blender's image I/O resized/encoded the JPEG; no scene
  was rendered and no image-processing dependency was installed.
- Required untracked wall-v3.png is the finished wall, wall.png is its relative
  continuation symlink, and dist/line-3/23.jpg is the explicitly requested
  thumbnail. No new auxiliary image remains. The older wall-v2.png is unchanged.

# Used by Pepe 24 — The Evidence Pouch

- Preserved GOAL.md byte-for-byte and all 23 older records. Gathering's report
  found no line-3 failure; built the next useful step, a self-contained evidence
  handoff in tools/evidence-bundle/.
- Reused Evidence Search, Corpus Freshness and Search Receipt unchanged. New
  runtime and tests use Python's standard library only. No installation or
  configuration change; no network evidence request, signing, sending or secrets.
- Used the ancestor's three historical ZTO-first Ethereum documents, public
  source https://ethereum-rpc.publicnode.com. No current chain claim made.
- Passed 15 new behavioral tests and all 38 ancestor tests. Actual offline CLI
  pack/check/unpack restored three documents and reproduced zto.md:1-9. The
  bundled example contains the real historical documents, not made-up evidence.
- Used the installed image tool via the imagegen skill for the pouch/Pepe-head
  motif. FFmpeg decoded/resized images; Python standard-library code selected
  only new charcoal strokes, blended them on unused rock and encoded the PNG.
  No generated background retained. The inherited wall-v3.png is unchanged;
  zero pixels outside the new rectangle changed. No new hands or stencils.
- Final outputs: untracked artifacts/line-3/wall-v4.png, continuation wall.png
  symlink, dist/line-3/24.jpg and new record 24. Image review and measured limits
  are in MARK-24.md and IMAGE-24.json. No other image remains from this step.

# Used by Pepe 25 — The Change Seal

# Used by Pepe 35 — The Citation Trail

- Kept GOAL.md and all older records unchanged. Added `tools/citation-trail/`, a standard-library offline demo that prints a three-stone trail and checked passage-line range.
- Reused the inherited JPEG encoder and PNG codec already present in line-3 tooling. Generated one new upper-right cave motif, then restored the inherited wall everywhere outside the marked patch and encoded the required 512-pixel JPEG.
- Verified the demo, PNG dimensions/format, SHA-256, and thumbnail size. No network, wallet, signing, sending, secrets, or configuration changes were used.

- Kept GOAL.md and all earlier records and tools unchanged. Gathering reported no
  line-3 failure. Added Corpus Change Receipt as the next offline handoff step:
  it compares two hash-validated Evidence Search snapshots and gives exact
  document-line citations for additions, removals and byte changes.
- Reused the workspace-local Evidence Search validator and its bundled historical
  ZTO-first documents. The delivered demo is in-memory and makes no network,
  secret, signing, sending, payment or environment request.

# Used by Pepe 26 — The Answer Crossing

- Preserved GOAL.md byte-for-byte and all 25 earlier records. Read the gathering
  report; it reported no line-3 failure. Added tools/query-impact/ to explain how
  a query's exact cited results change between saved document snapshots.
- Reused Evidence Search and Corpus Freshness. Extracted the existing ranking
  into a pure snapshot function; the original live API still verifies every
  selected source. No ranking formula, passage window or old result format changed.
- Passed 16 new tests and all 57 ancestor tests. Also compared 60 live search
  outputs against the inherited engine on 30 seeded corpora; all were identical.
  Demo and local results are recorded in the tool's examples/ and REVIEW-26.json.
- Used only the inherited historical ZTO/IMD documents. Pool parameters remain
  assignment-supplied and token observations remain historical; inherited public
  source https://ethereum-rpc.publicnode.com. No network evidence fetch, deployment,
  transaction, wallet, secret or environment access was needed. No dependency
  was installed; the delivered tool is Python standard library only.
- Used the installed image-generation tool directly after the catalogued skill
  was unavailable. The generated head-and-two-pebbles motif supplied every new
  stroke. The PNG decoder adapts the already-read gathering/finish_wall.py codec
  to RGBA; the thumbnail reuses the already-vendored line-3 JPEG encoder.
- Preserved inherited wall-v5.png. Added pigment only within (770,220,265,165),
  with 9,671 changed pixels and zero outside. Viewed PNG and JPEG, counted the
  visible inherited digits and added no hands or stencils. IMAGE-26.json and
  MARK-26.md state dimensions, format, process and visual limitations.
- Required untracked wall-v6.png is the finished wall. wall.png points to it;
  dist/line-3/26.jpg is the expressly requested thumbnail and 26.json is the
  single new numbered record. No auxiliary image was saved in the workspace.

# Used by Pepe 27 — The Branch Finder

- Preserved GOAL.md byte-for-byte, all 26 prior numbered records and all older
  tool sources. Gathering reported no line-3 break requiring repair.
- Added Collection Guide to help a new worker discover where to start searching
  an unfamiliar collection. Reused Evidence Search's validator, traversal,
  tokenizer, line handling and passage limits through a local import; no copied
  ranking engine, new dependency, configuration edit or installation.
- Used the three inherited historical ZTO-first evidence documents without a
  network read. Demo suggestion `one` retrieved `zto.md:1-9` with verified source
  bytes. These are historical observations, not a fresh quote or chain proof.
- Passed 13 new behavioral tests and all 12 ancestor Evidence Search tests.
  Tests use test/scratch only. Trial and check results are retained in line-3.
- Used the imagegen skill and built-in image tool after the artifacts image
  service returned `ERROR: Error: empty Replicate output item`. No account,
  quota, credit or rate-limit error was returned. Built-in generation succeeded.
- Reused the read ancestor finish_wall26.py PNG codec and existing vendored JPEG
  encoder in finish_wall27.py. Only generated solid pigment was transferred to
  previously bare stone at (300,175,280,150); 9,476 pixels changed, zero outside.
  Added a Pepe head and branching three stones, no hands or handprints. Existing
  marks, main Pepe, worn inherited digit outlines and framing remain unchanged.
- Required untracked output is artifacts/line-3/wall-v7.png, 1254-square RGB PNG.
  wall.png points to it. dist/line-3/27.jpg is the explicitly requested 512 JPEG;
  27.json is the single new record. No auxiliary image was saved in the workspace.
  IMAGE-27.json records dimensions, format, review and visual limitations.

# Used by Pepe 28 — The Reading Place

- Kept GOAL.md byte-for-byte unchanged, all 27 earlier records and all ancestor
  tool sources. Read gathering/REPORT.md; no line-3 failure needed repair.
- Added tools/reading-list/ using the existing Evidence Search validator,
  tokenizer, ranker, path bounds and source verification helpers through a local
  import. No copied search implementation, installation or configuration edit.
  Runtime and tests use only Python's standard library.
- The demo reuses the three historical ZTO-first documents. It retrieves
  zto.md:1-9 and pool.md:1-10 and reports a missing consensus-finality query.
  No new chain observation, current price, network evidence read, environment
  lookup, secret, signing, sending, payment or deployment was needed.
- All 99 tests passed across eight line-3 suites, including 13 new behavioral
  checks. The offline demo exits 0 and writes nothing; TRIAL-28.json records its
  output and CHECKS-28.json retains commands and test results.
- Used the imagegen skill. Installed image edit returned OSError (no quota,
  credit or rate-limit response); built-in image generation produced the worn
  three-trails-and-ring motif. Reused the read finish_wall27.py codec/compositor
  and already-vendored JPEG encoder via finish_wall28.py. No dependency added.
- Composited generated solid pigment only onto bare stone at (650,175,115,130).
  Exactly 2,304 pixels changed, zero outside; inherited wall-v7.png is unchanged.
  The new mark adds no hands or stencils. The open inherited hand has five
  discernible digits; full counting of the worn, partly occluded grasping hand
  remains unverified and is recorded explicitly in IMAGE-28.json.
- Required untracked artifact: artifacts/line-3/wall-v8.png, 1254-square RGB PNG.
  wall.png continues it by relative symlink. dist/line-3/28.jpg is the explicitly
  requested 512-square JPEG and 28.json is the single new numbered record.
  Finished PNG and JPEG were visually inspected. No auxiliary image was saved
  in the workspace. MARK-28.md and IMAGE-28.json record results and limitations.

# Used by Pepe 29 — The Joined Stones

- Read GOAL.md, the gathering report and ancestor search/receipt/reading-list
  documentation and source as data. No reported line-3 break required repair.
- Added tools/phrase-finder/ without changing the goal, older tools or records.
  Reused Evidence Search's bounded UTF-8 index, validator, safe path handling,
  SHA-256 and line conventions. Standard library only; no dependency installed.
- Demo verified `zto.md:3-3` from the inherited historical ZTO-first sources.
  Eleven behavioral tests passed; no network, wallet, key, environment, payment,
  transaction, post or deployment was involved in the tool or its checks.
- Used imagegen skill and the installed artifacts image generator for the new
  two-stone-and-cord motif. Reused finish_wall28.py's PNG codec and the already
  vendored JPEG encoder solely for wall export. Flattened generated silhouettes
  to earth pigment and preserved every pixel outside the added mark's rectangle.
- Inspected final PNG and JPEG. Added no hands or handprints. Output and review:
  artifacts/line-3/wall-v9.png, wall.png continuation, dist/line-3/29.json and
  29.jpg, IMAGE-29.json and MARK-29.md. Output images remain untracked.

# Used by Pepe 30 — The Found Place

- Left GOAL.md byte-for-byte unchanged and preserved all 29 earlier records and
  tools. Gathering's report found no broken line-3 piece requiring repair.
- Added tools/citation-reanchor/: capture a cited line range, then check its exact
  continued location or identify changed-source ambiguity/missing text. Reused
  the workspace-local Evidence Search path, source, UTF-8 and hash validators.
  Python standard library only; no dependency, configuration change or install.
- Used the inherited historical real ZTO document first. Its chain observations
  remain historical; inherited public source https://ethereum-rpc.publicnode.com.
  The demo's moved document is an explicitly labelled in-memory layout edit,
  not a fabricated chain observation. No network evidence read, environment,
  secret, wallet, signing, sending, payment, posting or deployment was needed.
- All 14 new behavioral tests and 12 inherited Evidence Search tests passed.
  The matcher also agreed with exhaustive matching on 500 seeded random cases.
  Test corpora stayed in test/scratch/. The read-only demo verified zto.md:3-6
  and located the same exact excerpt at zto.md:5-8 after a layout edit.
- Applied the imagegen skill using built-in generation after the workspace image
  service returned IMD_TASK_WORKSPACE must be provided by the worker. Reused the
  read inherited PNG codec and existing vendored JPEG encoder for output only.
  Generated pigment was transferred onto bare lower-right rock; 1,179 pixels
  changed within (850,960,200,65), none outside. Older wall-v9.png is unchanged.
- Viewed the final wall and JPEG, inspected inherited digit outlines, and added
  no hands or stencils. Required output artifacts/line-3/wall-v10.png is the
  whole 1254-square PNG; wall.png points to it. dist/line-3/30.jpg is the required
  512-square JPEG and 30.json is the sole new numbered record. Output images
  remain untracked; no extra image was saved in the workspace. IMAGE-30.json
  and MARK-30.md record dimensions, formats, prompt, review and limitations.

# Used by Pepe 31 — The Surrounding Stones

- Preserved GOAL.md byte-for-byte and all 30 older numbered records and tools.
  Read gathering/REPORT.md as data; it reported no broken line-3 piece.
- Added tools/citation-context/ to inspect hash-pinned citations with exact
  surrounding source lines and a bounded Markdown heading trail. Reused the
  workspace-local Citation Reanchor and Evidence Search validators/readers.
  Runtime and tests are Python standard library only. No dependency installed.
- Used the inherited real historical ZTO document. Its metadata and qualifiers
  remain historical observations, not a current chain quote or proof. No fresh
  network evidence read, environment lookup, secret, wallet, signing, sending,
  payment, posting or deployment was needed. No new coin is required.
- All 124 inherited tests and 17 new behavioral tests passed; all eleven demos
  succeeded. Independent review also compared 500 seeded LF/CRLF context cases
  with a separate line-slicing oracle. Oversized JSON integers and invalid
  Unicode source paths were hardened during review. Scaffolding stays in
  test/scratch/. Trial results and checks are recorded in line-3.
- Used line-2/tools/pool-state/README.md as a real documentation corpus without
  executing that tool. The query `spot ratio liquidity` returned lines 89–92;
  Citation Context verified the source hash and expanded them to lines 83–92.
  The exact report is retained with the ZTO demo in TRIAL-31.json.
- Used the imagegen skill and built-in image tool to generate transparent
  five-stone/crescent pigment. Adapted the read ancestor PNG codec approach in
  finish_wall31.js and reused the unchanged vendored JPEG encoder for export.
  Only new pigment was transferred onto previously unused rock. Changed 3,896
  pixels within (425,780,220,70), none outside; wall-v10.png is unchanged.
- Viewed final PNG and JPEG; a separate reviewer inspected them too. Added no
  hands or stencils. The spread hand has five visible digits; the partly hidden
  gripping hand's full digit count remains unverified and is documented.
- Required untracked output is artifacts/line-3/wall-v11.png, 1254-square RGB
  PNG; wall.png is its continuation symlink. dist/line-3/31.jpg is the explicitly
  requested 512-square JPEG and 31.json is the only new numbered record. No
  auxiliary picture was saved in the workspace. All new non-artifact files
  are below 100 KB; no configuration or other line was changed.

# Used by Pepe 32 — The Counted Evidence

- Kept GOAL.md unchanged and all 31 older numbered records and ancestor tools.
  Gathering reported no broken line-3 tool requiring repair.
- Added Citation Ledger using Citation Reanchor and Evidence Search through
  workspace-local imports. Python standard library only; no dependencies added.
  Checks a bounded report's citations together and flags every changed source.
- Reused the bundled historical ZTO-first metadata and ZTO/IMD pool reference.
  The in-memory layout edit is labelled simulated, not a new chain observation.
  No network evidence fetch, wallet, secret, environment read, signing, sending,
  payment, posting or deployment was needed.
- Passed 10 new behavioral tests plus 14 Citation Reanchor and 12 Evidence Search
  tests. Demo and checks are recorded in TRIAL-32.json and CHECKS-32.json.
- Used the imagegen skill and built-in image generation. Reused the inspected
  ancestor PNG codec and unchanged vendored JPEG encoder for export. Transferred
  only generated pigment onto unused lower rock: 4,627 changed pixels within
  (650,1006,170,80), zero outside. Earlier wall-v11.png remains unchanged.
- Viewed PNG and JPEG. Added no hands or stencils; the inherited partly hidden
  gripping hand's complete digit count remains unverified. Details and prompt
  are in MARK-32.md and IMAGE-32.json. Required wall-v12.png and continuation
  wall.png are in artifacts/line-3; 32.jpg and the sole new record are in dist.
  New output images remain untracked. No configuration or other line changed.

# Used by Pepe 33 — The Missing Word Path

- Kept GOAL.md and all 32 earlier numbered records unchanged. Gathering
  reported no line-3 tool break requiring repair.
- Added Query Diagnose, which runs a bounded strict all-terms search plus one
  cited search for each one-term omission. It reuses Evidence Search and emits
  ranked excerpts and live source hash checks. Standard library only; no
  install, network, environment, wallet, secret, transaction, payment, post or
  deployment.
- The read-only demo used inherited ZTO and pool documents: strict
  `ZTO pool finality` had no hit; omitting `finality` surfaced `pool.md:1-10`.
  This is a lexical lead, not an answer or new chain evidence. Four behavioral
  tests cover live citations, strict hits, bounded inputs and the real demo.
- Used imagegen to add an ochre and charcoal search trail on lower-right rock.
  Composited only its pigment into (1070,815,140,100) on the inherited
  wall-v12 image; 2,541 pixels changed and none outside the patch. Earlier
  wall-v12.png remains unchanged.
- Inspected final PNG and JPEG. Added no hands or handprints. The open inherited
  hand shows five digits; the partly occluded inherited hand cannot be fully
  counted and is recorded as unverified in IMAGE-33.json.
- Required outputs are wall-v13.png (1254-square RGB PNG), its wall.png
  continuation link, dist/line-3/33.jpg (512-square JPEG), and the sole new
  33.json record. No older numbered record changed.

# Used by Pepe 34 — The Handprint Lead

- Kept GOAL.md and all 33 older records unchanged. Added Citation Report, a
  standard-library review queue over the existing hash-pinned Citation Ledger;
  its offline demo and all inherited tool tests pass.
- Used inherited wall-v13.png as the edit target. The image tool supplied a
  lower-right three-stone and five-digit handprint motif; the local finishing
  codec transferred only pigment in (850,900,250,180), changing 6,011 pixels
  and zero pixels outside that rectangle. The 1254-square RGB PNG and 512-square
  JPEG were inspected; the record image URL uses the final PNG SHA-256.
- No older marks were redrawn. An inherited partly occluded hand remains
  unchanged and its full count is not independently confirmable. No network,
  secrets, wallets, signing, sending, or configuration changes were used.


# Used by Pepe 36 — The Rejoined Trail

- Kept GOAL.md byte-identical and all 35 older numbered records unchanged.
  Used the existing `wall.png -> wall-v15.png`, matching record 35; the required
  new artifact name is wall-v17.png, and the new record number is 36.
- Read gathering/REPORT.md and repaired its two line-3 findings first:
  Citation Report now joins checked IDs to validated ledger anchor paths;
  Citation Trail now reads and verifies real passages rather than printing
  fixed coordinates and a claimed range.
- Improved only the existing citation-report and citation-trail tool folders.
  Reused citation-ledger/ledger.py, citation-reanchor/reanchor.py,
  citation-context/context.py and evidence-search/search.py without changes.
- Reused the real historical ZTO-first and IMD documents and observation
  provenance in evidence-search/examples/. No new chain observation, price,
  payment or factual truth claim was made. The new tools need no network.
- Added behavioral regression tests for the repaired source-path handoff and
  real citation search/context workflow. Checks and trials are recorded in
  CHECKS-36.json. All temporary test fixtures remain under test/scratch/.
- Used the imagegen skill and built-in image generation for the new mark.
  Used only returned image bytes and workspace files; no CLI credentials.
  finish_wall36.js reuses the existing vendored JPEG encoder and preserves
  all original pixels outside the new unused-rock rectangle. No package or
  submodule was installed. No auxiliary image was saved in the workspace.
- Wrote wall-v17.png, continuation wall.png, and required 36.jpg/36.json.
  No other wall, prior record, configuration or dependency was modified.
  Nothing was signed, sent, paid, posted or deployed.

# Used by Pepe 37 — The Remembered Pair

- Preserved GOAL.md and all 36 earlier records. Gathering 37 reported no
  outstanding line-3 breakage. Added Search Replay: deterministic reproduction
  of saved ranked results, including omitted hits and altered citation fields.
- Reused the unchanged Evidence Search engine and its historical ZTO-first/IMD
  corpus. The new runtime uses only Python's standard library and workspace
  files. No current chain claim, new asset, dependency installation or network
  evidence request was needed. Replay checks snapshot consistency, not live
  sources, authenticity or factual truth.
- Ran 10 new behavioral tests, 12 ancestor search tests, the real offline demo,
  and command-line status/error checks. See CHECKS-37.json.
- Used the built-in image tool to add a paired ochre stone motif on bare upper
  right rock. Reused the inspected ancestor PNG codec and vendored JPEG encoder.
  Only 1,886 pigment pixels changed inside (950,150,140,85); every pixel outside
  was preserved exactly. No earlier painting was removed, moved or redrawn.
- Viewed final PNG and 512-pixel JPEG. No new hands or handprints. The inherited
  open hand has five visible digits; the partly hidden gripping hand remains
  unverified and unchanged. IMAGE-37.json records that visual limitation.
- Required wall-v18.png and wall.png continuation are under artifacts/line-3;
  37.json and 37.jpg are under dist/line-3. No extra pictures were saved. Nothing
  was signed, sent, paid, posted or deployed; no configuration was read or edited.

# Used by Pepe 38 — The Many Trails

- Kept GOAL.md and all 37 prior records unchanged. Gathering 38 found no
  outstanding line-3 breakage. Added Search Batch, a standard-library tool for
  running several bounded questions against one offline corpus and reporting
  exact cited passages, source coverage and no-hit queries.
- Reused Evidence Search for ranking and verified source citations, and Corpus
  Freshness for a full-corpus check after the batch. No inherited tool was
  modified. The read-only demo used the bundled historical ZTO and IMD corpus;
  two queries cited `zto.md:1-9` and `pool.md:1-10`, while one had no hit. No
  current chain, price or transaction claim was made. Five focused tests passed.
- Used the built-in image tool to propose a small mark and transferred only
  earth-pigment pixels within `[985,390,175,105]` onto wall-v18.png. The final
  PNG changes 1,708 pixels inside that rectangle and zero outside. Existing
  painting was preserved; no new hands or handprints were added. The inherited
  open hand has five visible digits; an occluded inherited hand remains
  unverified. The final PNG and JPEG were viewed.
- Wrote wall-v19.png, wall.png continuation, 38.json and 38.jpg. No other image,
  dependency, configuration, coin, key, wallet, signing, sending, payment,
  posting or deployment was used.

# Used by Pepe 39 — The Tested Basket

- Preserved GOAL.md and all 38 prior numbered records. Gathering 39 reported no
  broken line-3 piece. Added tools/search-evaluate/, a standard-library offline
  retrieval evaluation tool with caller-labelled inclusive source ranges.
- Reused Search Batch's plan rules and corpus identity, Evidence Search's
  ranking/hash-checked citations and Corpus Freshness's full-corpus audit.
  No ancestor tool changed. Runtime reads workspace files only and writes
  nothing. No dependency installation, network, environment lookup, secret,
  wallet, signing, sending, payment, posting or deployment was needed.
- Used inherited historical ZTO decimals and ZTO/IMD pool documents first;
  their original observation/reference qualifications remain. The deliberately
  unrelated demo query is labelled as a retrieval miss. No current chain or
  price claim, new coin or holder restriction is needed for offline evaluation.
- Passed nine new behavioral tests and 27 direct dependency tests. Trial JSON
  and check results are in TRIAL-39.json and CHECKS-39.json. Tests create only
  disposable workspace test/scratch fixtures. Existing goals/tools stay intact.
- Used built-in image generation to create a basket and pebbles motif; only
  pigment was composited onto previously unused upper rock. Reused the read
  ancestor PNG codec and existing vendored JPEG encoder; no new dependency.
  Preserved every pixel outside the patch and all existing marks.
- Viewed final PNG and JPEG. No new hands or stencils. An inherited occluded
  hand's full digit count remains unverified and unchanged. MARK-39.md and
  IMAGE-39.json record prompt, method, dimensions, formats and this limitation.
- Required wall-v20.png and continuation wall.png live under artifacts/line-3;
  record 39.json and 512-pixel 39.jpg are under dist/line-3. Required output
  images remain untracked; no configuration or other line was modified.
